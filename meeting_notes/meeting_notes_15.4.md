NEXT TO DO: 
	1. abstract designg to include data strictures/file structure, databases, actions 
	(search, tree hiearhie)
	2. 

DOCUMENTATION/IDEAS:  
 	tags should be be self describable 
 	
 	1. for searcing: by tags  (searcing for subset/(check superset)
 				:optins -> supersets
 					-> setsimularitys 
 					basic idea if you have more with same name to give back all of them
 	2. this can be implemented with inverted files
 	3. Put simple words in some hierayh (prboably shoud be good to crate some simple example for hierarhy)
 				
 				
 Maybe focus coiuld be on inverted files (search on base lists), sematics of inverted files
 
 
UI: 
	 it should be stored in hierarhi, (also seable in IU)
 		1. think how to combine theom, because of adding... 
 		2. it would be good to use same name for tag and direcory\
 		
 	good example is PINTEREST
